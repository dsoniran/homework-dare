Homework: Lesson 7 – Git & GitHub

Question 1

Complete definitions for key Git & GitHub terminology

GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS
• Working Directory (or Working Tree) - consists of files that you are currently working on.
• Staging Area (or Index) - where commits are prepared
• Repository (or Repo) - is the 'container' that tracks the changes to your project files
• Local Repo (head) - is hosted on a local machine for an individual user
• Remote repo (master) - is hosted on a remote or off-site server that is shared among multiple team members

WORKING DIRECTORY STATES:
• Modified - the change will only be found in the working directory
• Staged - the changes (if you want to include them) in your next commit
• Committed - The modified files will be safely stored in the repo. You can add a message describing what you changed

GIT COMMANDS:
• Git add - used to add files to the staging area
Syntax git add <file_name.txt>

• Git commit -  creates a snapshot of the changes and save it to the git directory.
Syntax git commit -m "Message to go with the commit here (usually about changes made)"

• Git push - used to send local commits to the master branch of the remote repository.
Syntax git push origin <master>

• Git fetch - allows users to fetch all objects from the remote repository that don’t currently reside in the local working directory.
Syntax git fetch origin

• Git merge - used to merge a branch into the active one.
Syntax git merge <branch-name>

• Git pull - merges all the changes present in the remote repository to the local working directory.
Syntax git pull

Question 2

Note that from now on we will be actively using Git & GitHub to share materials and manage our code, as well as homework.

TASK
• In your GitHub create a new repo called Homework.
• Add your instructor as a collaborator to this repo, so they can access your homework submissions in the future and comment on your code.
• Clone this repo to your machine
• Create a new file called my_first_git_homework_<your_name>.txt
• Commit and push it to the remote repo
• Ensure that the new file can be seen in your GitHub when you access it
